# Quantum-Key-Distribution-for-Secure-Communication
In the era of quantum computing in digital world,
security in data transmission or secure communication is very
important and crucial. There are many factors that compromises
security and one of them is scheduling strategies of quantum
tasks (QTasks). Traditional method of scheduling involves First
Come First Serve (FCFS) strategy which has many limitations in
terms of itâ€™s performance as well as in generation of encryption
key for secure communication between parties. The main idea
behind this project is to implement Round Robin (RR) scheduling
algorithm in iQuantum simulator to improve efficiency, and
overall performance of quantum computing providing low latency
and enhanced security.However, this work aims to analyze the
impact caused by different scheduling strategies in field of
Quantum Key Distribution and Quantum Simulation.
